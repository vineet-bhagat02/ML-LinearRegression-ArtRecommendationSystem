The Gujarat Riots—Hindus and Muslims

All of us are Indians, Hindus and Muslims. Dear God, is this a gift from you?  There was a riot in Gujarat, and so many have lost their lives.  Were they beasts that they didn’t spare mothers, sisters who were unable to recognize the bodies? Oh Khoda, oh God, we are all Indians, Hindus and Muslims.

Joy was returning slowly to Gujarat after the earthquake. But it didn’t last, due to the riots. Oh Khoda, oh God, we are all Indians, Hindus and Muslims.
Once, a Hindu boy became an orphan, losing his parents in the earthquake.
They were brought up by Muslim foster parents. Oh Khoda, oh God, we are all Indians, Hindus and Muslims.

The boy grew up and fell in love with a Hindu girl. The mother had no objection, but the father stopped him. Oh Khoda, oh God, we are all Indians, Hindus and Muslims.

There was a huge fight between the parents.  Unable to convince them, the boy committed suicide. Oh Khoda, oh God, we are all Indians, Hindus and Muslims.

All the neighbors came to know; the police came. From this event the riots began. Oh Khoda, oh God, we are all Indians, Hindus and Muslims.

The devils even cut out the unborn fetus from the mother’s wombs. Oh God, never forgive these devils. Oh Khoda, oh God, we are all Indians, Hindus and Muslims.

Instead of politicizing with communities, aim for harmony.  God and Nature are the same. God has proved it. Oh Khoda, oh God, we are all Indians, Hindus and Muslims.

That is why I say—don’t play with the lives of the scroll painters. Have some concern for human beings. Oh Khoda, oh God, we are all Indians, Hindus and Muslims.

This is my appeal. Oh Khoda, oh God, we are all Indians, Hindus and Muslims.
