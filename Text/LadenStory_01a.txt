11th September, the story of American Center’s destruction.

O the strange story of the plane attack in America. Repeat.
Everybody was shocked, saying—we haven’t heard something like this ever.
A fighter plane came and hit a 110 story building and destroyed it. All who were there perished, burning alive none of them survived.
O the strange story of the plane attack in America.
Many people worked in the building. They were killed in the fire, with god’s name on their lips. What sins had they committed o god, you tell us.
O the strange story of the plane attack in America.
Mothers cry, as sons, birds and beasts. You have taken away everything o merciful one; you have left us nothing. Laden had thought to himself—let George Bush fight with me. Who can save them? No trace will be found. But the army came, took photos. They braved themselves to say—how can the thousands of people be saved!
George Bush told them at the meeting—Laden is responsible. Find him. He releases thousands of soldiers, telling them Laden is in Afghanistan. Kill him. Continue the war.
O the strange story of the plane attack in America.
Thousands of soldiers lost their lives, but Laden couldn’t be found. The rascal George Bush couldn’t even find a trace of Laden.

O the strange story of the plane attack in America.
