Tsunami the destruction of everything took so many lives, took so many lives.
So many people drowned; there is no record of how many died.
So many houses went under water, nobody knows how many.
Tsunami, the destruction, took so many lives, took so many lives.

Dayal, it took lives.
Many journalists were trying to get news. They came in groups to help and ended up as saviors, providing courage.
Tsunami the destruction of everything took so many lives, took so many lives.
Birds and beasts cried and said oh Khoda how can we survive?
Tsunami the destruction of everything took so many lives, took so many lives.
The women who lit lamps under the basil (Tulsi) every morning and evening were taken away by you Dayal, you didn’t spare them
 
Governments at home and abroad have opened shelters—pay attention Indians.
Tsunami the destruction of everything took so many lives, took so many lives.

The scientists have warned us Indians that in case of a second invasion, nobody will survive.
