Text:
Oh mother of the ocean, Mother of Ganga, why did you take so many lives (forcibly).  Oh, brother, the sea water cane in a great rush, with trees and leaves floating in it. So many men are killed. My heart weeps for them.

Mothers are bereft of children; children lose their mothers, wives are husbandless. What pain; Oh Dayal (merciful one) of my heart; how my heart weeps.

The sky weeps, the wind cries, the unlucky mother weeps for her lost kids.

It is hard to understand your play (Lila, khela). How you make some cry and others smile.

The army came when they got the news. They rescue people, shedding tears.

Sri Lanka, Thailand, Andamanâ€”people from 12 countries died untimely deaths
