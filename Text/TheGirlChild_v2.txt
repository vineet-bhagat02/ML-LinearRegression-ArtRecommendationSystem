Girl children
Listen to me all of you, listen carefully.
Let me talk about girl children. Pay attention please.

Parents are sad at the birth of girl children. O uncontrollable mind, girl children are neglected. Listen to me all of you, listen carefully.

Why should the little flowers be neglected, close to her mother’s heart?
Listen to me all of you, listen carefully.

A little after her birth, there is no mother’s milk for her. Girls are future mothers, they require milk.
Listen to me all of you, listen carefully.

Take the baby to the health center a month after her birth. Don’t forget to vaccinate her against polio.
Listen to me all of you, listen carefully.

Girls have to be educated. Allow them to play. Bring her up with care. Forgive her if she makes a mistake.
Listen to me all of you, listen carefully.

Your daughter can be a teacher or doctor in future and help her parents.
Listen to me all of you, listen carefully.

Girls go out to work on the fields; come back and look after the house.
Listen to me all of you, listen carefully.

Matangini Hajra was a woman who sacrificed her life for her country.  She tried to
Drive out the British, for the benefit of her countrymen.

Listen to me all of you, listen carefully.
