The US plane attacks—11th September

The plane attacks on US are a weird incident. George Bush tells Laden what a mystery is this?  There can be no greater harm than what you have done. Oh God tell me how I can erase this sorrow! The weird incident of the plane attacks.
Laden tells all his men—listen. My nemesis is approaching. I can’t stay here any more.
I am being blamed by everyone. Oh Khoda tell me why.
The plane attacks on US are a weird incident.
George Bush appeals to other Westerners to help him catch Laden. Some say it’s Ramji Singh, others think of Abu Salem. Yet others think it is Osama Bin laden. It is all conjectures.
Everyone knows officers in American Center. The terrorist attack, bullet shooting, and cannon attack there was bad.
The plane attacks on US are a weird incident.
Talibans are constantly spraying bullets on temples and mosques. They call on people to drink dog blood & turn into human bombs.
